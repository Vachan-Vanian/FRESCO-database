Progressive horizontal cracking from knee to fifth course along tension column.,"Initial boundary cracking terminated uncracked mode, followed by panel acting as diagonal strut. Low shear capacity of unreinforced panel caused bearing forces near diagonal crack ends to produce successive horizontal cracks. Each crack relieved bearing on that course and transferred load to next course. Insufficient shear capacity in compression column prevented full moment capacity development.",Minor damage until sudden boundary cracking at 169.0 kN with accompanying load drop.
